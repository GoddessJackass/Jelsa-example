        <h1>Welcome to site about Jelsa!</h1>
        <p>The town Jelsa is located in the middle of the island of Hvar and is mild, clean and open hearted to the guests and travelers.
            Jelsa is surrounded by the two highest mountains on the island - in the west St. Nikola, and in the east Hum. From the south side Jelsa is surrounded by mountains Vrh, Samotorac and Gozd from the north side it is protected from cold north winds by the hill Biokovo.</p>
        <p>Jelsa may be just a little town in the middle of Hvar Island, as a popular song has it, but it boasts a wide harbour and attractive stone waterfront. Once a fishing centre, in the 19th century Jelsa had an important fleet of trading sailboats, some of which were even ocean-going, and was part of the enviable fishing epopee which lasted some fifty years, plying its trade to Lampedusa and around the Mediterranean.</p>
        <p>This picturesque settlement, which in winter is exposed to the northerly wind called the ‘bura’, was first mentioned in 14th century historical records as a port three kilometres away from the village of Pitve, which is situated on the northern slopes of the Gozd hill. Although Jelsa itself counts among the newer of Hvar Island’s settlements, there are signs of human habitation dating back some 5000 years not far away.</p>
        <p>In 1868, at the time of national revival amid rising national awareness, the first Croatian reading room / library was opened on the Dalmatian islands. In 1878, the library gained the right to fly the Croatian tricolour flag. In 1880, Jelsa’s school was among the first in Dalmatia to introduce teaching in the Croatian language. The library carried various daily newspapers, and became the centre of political life in Jelsa. It was transferred to the new Town Hall on February 1st 1896, when it held a celebration in honour of its founding over a quarter of a century previously. The Town Hall itself was only given the right to fly the Croatian flag later, in 1907.</p>
